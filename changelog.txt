0.6
* wire specified trigger objects to scenegraph (implemented for Draw2D only, Java3D not working yet, others not at all)
* added foreground (implemented in Draw2D only, lazy impl: background works in building scene, foreground in changing scene, to be fixed)

0.7
* resolve IfcRelAssociates abnormality (http://code.google.com/p/bimserver/wiki/Known_issues)
* Foreground/background (GraphObject2D) options for all Draw2D objects
* GAEB_Barchart config: clean and truncate text, use IT instead of UP
* separate condition objects -> factor out filter libraries
