* ensure consistent filtering and checking on model level throughout all accessors
* generalize accessor conditions
* tie configuration and model conditions in case of complex conditions (e.g. multi model) where type of data elements is not enough
* "map to component" configurations e.g. map to Gannntt chart?
* mix different filter libraries?
