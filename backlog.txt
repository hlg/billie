* generic multi model accessor: check required models and throw error if not fulfilled
* ensure consistent filtering and checking on model level throughout all accessors
* better exception handling e.g. file not found

* generalize accessor conditions
* tie configuration and model conditions in case of complex conditions (e.g. multi model) where type of data elements is not enough

* make cost visualizations work with GAEB-split model instead of QTO & GAEB
* make schedule visualizations work with ICAL instead of activity
* make HEB work with GAEB-split instead of QTO&GAEB

* "map to component" configurations e.g. map to Gannntt chart?

* bug: Simpleviewer initialized without loader, but invoked with path in stead of scene graph -> Nullpointer

* integration tests with existing visualizations (configurations)
* mix different filter libraries?
* make page for github (will be public though the repo is private)
